CLASSIFIED PROJECT DOSSIER: INTERCEPT

Subject: REAL-TIME HELIOSPHERIC RECEIVER
Clearance: EXECUTIVE
Date: December 27, 2025
Status: REFACTORED FOR SIMPLICITY

1. THE VISION (The Pivot)
The Old Premise:
A "Cosmic Radio" dashboard that visualizes data with maps and plays music. (REJECTED: Too passive, too cluttered).
The New Premise:
INTERCEPT is an atmospheric receiver. It allows a user on Earth to "tune in" to the electromagnetic frequency of the Sun in real-time. It is not a dashboard; it is an instrument. It transforms invisible data streams into a tactile, audio-visual presence in the room.
The Core Emotion:
We are not aiming for "Education." We are aiming for "Awe." The feeling of sitting in a bunker, listening to a storm rage outside, safe but connected.

2. THE EXPERIENCE (User Journey)
A. The Ritual (No Autoplay)
The application does not simply "start."
 * The Static: Upon load, the user hears only white noise and low-hum static. The screen is 90% black.
 * The Tuner: A single, high-fidelity dial (or scroll mechanic) sits at the bottom. The user must "search" the frequency.
 * The Lock: As they scroll near the live data stream, the static resolves into a clear, harmonic drone. The visual anchor snaps into focus.
 * The Voice: The AI Sentry whispers: "Signal acquired. Telemetry live."
B. The Visual Anchor (The "Breathing Ring")
 * The Concept: Radical Minimalism. No maps. No gauges. No 3D solar systems.
 * The Object: A single, perfect ring of light in the center of the void (OLED Black).
   * Calm State: The ring "breathes" slowly (expands/contracts) in sync with the Solar Wind Speed.
   * Storm State: The ring does not shake. It fractures. The edge creates "ghosting" artifacts. The color shifts from cool Blue/White to Warning Amber.
   * Text: Data points (Speed: 450 km/s) appear only as subtle, monospace overlays near the ring, like a fighter jet HUD.
C. The Interaction (Signal Entropy)
 * The Problem: Ambient apps are ignored.
 * The Solution: The signal naturally "drifts" over time (simulating ionospheric entropy).
 * The Action: The audio will slowly introduce crackle/static. The user must gently nudge the Tuner to "clean" the signal. This creates a tactile bond between the user and the data.
3. THE ARCHITECTURE (Refined)
We retain the robust "Black Box" engine, but we repurpose how it is presented.
A. Signal Ingestion (The Source)
 * NASA DONKI & NOAA SWPC: Still the source of truth.
 * Modification: We strictly use the D-RAP (Interference) data to control the "Drift/Static" intensity, forcing the user to tune the dial.
B. Procedural Audio (The Texture)
 * The Drone: Tone.js synthesis. Deep, sub-bass drones representing Solar Wind.
 * The Artifacts: Instead of "music," we introduce "Glitch" sounds—digital chirps and high-frequency whines that represent X-Ray flux.
 * Silence: We implement "Negative Space." If the sun is quiet, the app is quiet. We do not fill the silence with filler music.
C. The Sentry (AI Persona)
 * Personality: "The Computer" (Star Trek) / "The Sentry."
 * Behavior: Stoic. Minimal.
 * Trigger: Speaks only on status change.
   * Bad: "Hey guys, looks like a flare."
   * Good: "Alert. M-Class Flare detected. Signal integrity compiling."
   
2. FEATURE: THE LOGBOOK (Retention)
Replaces: Gamification/Badges.
The Concept:
We do not give "rewards." We provide Evidence.
 * When a significant Cosmic Event (CME, Flare > M1, Geomagnetic Storm) occurs while the user is "Tuned In," the system generates a Time-Stamped Entry.
 * The Artifact: A downloadable, high-contrast, typographic image.
   * Content: The exact time (UTC), the Max Flux Intensity, and the Visual State of the Ring at that moment.
   * Caption: "SIGNAL INTERCEPTED. [Date]."
 * Value: It is a digital souvenir. A "First Edition" print of a cosmic event.
5. DESIGN PRINCIPLES (The Jobs Doctrine)
 * Invisible Tech: If the user notices the interface, we have failed. They should only notice the Signal.
 * Friction is Quality: The "Tuner" must feel heavy and precise. It is an instrument, not a toy.
 * No Decoration: If an element does not convey data (e.g., a background star field), delete it.
 * Audio First: The visual is secondary to the sound. The screen can be off, and the utility remains.
