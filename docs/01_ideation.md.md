# PROJECT INTERCEPT: INITIAL CONCEPTS

## The Core Premise
A "Thick Client" receiver that sonifies solar wind data.
Goal: Turn invisible physics into a visceral experience.

## The "Cosmic Radio" Metaphor
- Not a dashboard (Passive).
- A Receiver (Active).
- User must "Tune" into the signal.

## Initial Tech Stack Ideas
- Tone.js for audio (Pink noise + Sawtooth drone).
- React Three Fiber? (No, too heavy. Use 2D Canvas for "Oscilloscope" vibe).
- NASA DONKI API for data.
